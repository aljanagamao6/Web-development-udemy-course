Intro to CSS 

Objectives 
- Define CSS and the role that it plays in WebDev 
- View websites before and after css has been added 
- Understand the "general rule" for CSS syntax

Cascading Style Sheets = "The adjectives"
The General Rule 
selector {
    property: value; 
    anotherProperty: value;
}

Where do we write our styles? 
Inline, Style tag, or external stylesheet file

Colors in CSS 
- by using their color names 
- hexadecimal code(#+string of 6 hexadecimal numbers from 0-F) 
- rgb(Red, Green,Blue each ranges from 0-255)
- rgba(Just like RGB but with an alpha(transparency)channel ranges from 0.0-1.0)

Color and Background in CSS 
color - to set text color 
background - for background color

CSS Selectors 
Element, ID, Class 
1. Element selector - select ALL instances of a given element.
2. ID selector - selects an element with a GIVEN ID. only one per page!
    - ID is used to target a single item. 
    - it's a way to single something out. 
    - in CSS, you can select an id by using hash(#)
    - ID cannot be duplicated(meaning same name) you can use it multiple times but not same value
3. Class selector - selects all elements with a given Class
    - unlike ID, class can be duplicated and used multiple times in a page
    - in CSS, you can select a class by using dot(.)

CSS selectors you must know by heart
Resource: https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048

1. * - it will select EVERYTHING on the page 
2. Descendant selector - it takes two or more selectors or tag names chained together 
    - li a { } : this will select a because it's descendant to li
3. Adjacent selector - it will select that comes AFTER an element
    - h4 + ul { }
    - using + will target ul that are adjacent(comes after) to h4 
4. Attribute selector - way to select elements of any attribute 
    - a[href="http://www.google.com"] { } - it will select all a tags that has an href of google.com
    - input[type="checkbox"] { }
5.nth of type - it takes a number and it will select every nth of specific element in a given group
    - ul:nth-of-type(2) { }
    - ul:nth-of-type(even) or ul:nth-of-type(odd)

Specificity on CSS 
Resource: https://specificity.keegan.st/
    - we can have multiple styles targeting one element 
    - whatever style is closest related to the element, css will read it first
    - Type selectors are the least specific (li, li a, li+a)
    - Class, Attribute, Pseudo-class selectors (.hello, input[type='text'], a:hover) 
    - ID selectors are the most specific (#hello)

Text and Fonts on CSS 
1. font family, font size, font weight, line height, text-align, text-decoration
